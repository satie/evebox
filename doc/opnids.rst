OPNids
========================

Setup OPNids
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the latest OPNids distribution from ( `OPNids Download`_ ).

Once you have OPNids up and running, you can start to configure the
proper settings for Suricata, Dragonfly MLE, and Filebeats.

Setup Suricata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the navigation, select ``Suricata IDS`` > ``Administration``.

1. Check the ``Enabled`` checkbox.
2. Select the interface you would like suricata to be listening on. This
   should be the interface that is acting as your TAP.
3. Select ``Yes`` for each event type you are interested in.

Below is a screenshot sample of the settings we have just applied,
excluding interface selection. That may vary based on the host you have
installed OPNids.

1. Check the ``Enabled`` checkbox.

Once you have clicked ``Apply``. Dragonfly MLE will automatically start.

Setup Filebeats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the navigation, select ``Services`` > ``Beats`` > ``Filebeat``.

1. Check the ``Enabled`` checkbox.
2. By default, suricata ``eve.json`` path is located at
   ``/var/log/suricata/eve.json``. We want to switch this to use
   Dragonfly MLE logs. The default path for Dragonfly MLE logs is
   ``/var/log/dragonfly-mle/dragonfly-mle.log``.
3. Enter the host(s) for your Logstash host.
4. If you are using SSL encryption, enter the path to each file required
   and check ``Enabled SSL`` (OPTIONAL).
5. ``Apply`` settings.

If everything was done right, you can now click ``Test Configuration``
to test whether you have a valid filebeats configuration. You can also
click ``Test Connection`` to validate that you have a connection to your
Logstash host. If both validations are valid then there is nothing else
for you to do with the Filebeat settings. Check out the screenshot
below.

Once your done, you can navigate to the ``Dashboard`` in OPNids and
click the green play button for Filebeats.

If everything is up and running, you should see all three services
running within the ``Services`` widget.

Setup Logstash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your mileage may vary with Logstash, but for simplicity, below is a base
configuration for your ``logstash.conf``. Where you see
``elasticsearch:9200`` in the ``.conf`` should be replace with your
Elasticsearch host. You can leave it as its default if your planning to
run the Elasticsearch and Logstash using docker-compose.

.. code:: yaml

   input {
       beats {
           port => 5044
       }
   }
   filter {
       json {
           source => "message"
           remove_field => ["message"]
       }
   }
   output {
       elasticsearch {
           hosts => ["elasticsearch:9200"]
           manage_template => false
           index => "logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
       }
   }

Setup Evebox
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer back to `Evebox Documentation`_

If you have docker installed on the machine you are using and itâ€™s a
debian box. do the following.

.. code:: sh

   # clone repo down
   git clone https://github.com/counterflow-ai/evebox.git

   # move into the directory
   cd ./evebox

   # this will build distribution pkgs without you having to install dependencies
   ./docker.sh release

   # install debian package (may need sudo depending on user)
   dpkg -i dist/evebox-latest-amd64.deb

   # you now should be able to just run the below command. Change localhost to the IP of where your elasticsearch host is
   evebox -v -e http://localhost:9200 -i logstash --elasticsearch-keyword keyword

Happy Threat Hunting!
